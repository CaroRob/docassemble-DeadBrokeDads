question: |
  What does the Notice of Delinquent Child Support from DOR/CSE say?
subquestion: |
  These notices can be confusing. 
  
  The amount under other_parent.name.first's name,  is supposed to be your regular child support payment.

  In the middle is how often you are supposed to pay child support.

  The amount on the right is the amount of back child support that DOR CSE says you owe. This amount also includes any interest and penalties DOR CSE is charging you.
  
  What does DOR/CSE say these are?
  The notice should look something like this:
