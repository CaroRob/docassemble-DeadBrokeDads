question: |
  Welcome!
subquestion: |
  If the Department of Revenue Child Support Enforcement (DOR/CSE) sent you a Notice of Child Support Delinquency, you may not have to pay **everything** on the notice. 
  
  If DOR/CSE has taken some action that makes it hard for you pay back the child support you owe, you can ask them for a break.
  
  Sometimes the DOR makes mistakes.
  
  Sometimes they recognize that you cannot pay back everything. 
  They can decide not to charge you:

  * interest (?)
  * penalties
  * the amount of child support you owe them.*

  They can also undo actions they have taken that make it hard for you to pay overdue child support.
  
  We are going to ask you questions to help you fill out the forms you need to get help with your back child support. 

  Shall we get started?
yesno: get_started
section: Introduction
under: |
  Note: Just to be clear -  we can **only** help with money you owe the Department of Revenue. 
  You must still pay any back child support you owe your child's other parent.

question: |
  What does the Notice of Delinquent Child Support from DOR/CSE say?
subquestion: |
  These notices can be confusing. 
  
  The amount under ${other_parent.name.first}'s name,  is supposed to be your regular child support payment.

  In the middle is how often you are supposed to pay child support.

  The amount on the right is the amount of back child support that DOR CSE says you owe. This amount also includes any interest and penalties DOR CSE is charging you.
  
  What does DOR/CSE say these are?
  The notice should look something like this:
  [FILE DBD_NoticeTop.png]
fields:
  - 1. What is the date?: notice_date_delinquency
    datatype: date 
  - 2. Is the custodial parent's name **${other_parent.name}**?: other_parent_wrong

    required: False
    show if: other_parent_wrong
  - 2. What is custodial parent's last name?: dor_other_parent.name.last

  - 5. Total past due child support?: dor_cse_notice_arrears

question: |
  What court issued the child support order?
subquestion: |
  Look at the top of the child support order - the name of the court should be there.
fields:
  - no label: other_cs_court
---
question: |
  Is DOR/CSE charging you a penalty?
subquestion: |
  On page 6, the notice talks about the Special Tax Refund Rule,

  They say, "Here are the amounts we will tell the tax agency you owe now:"
fields:
  - What is the State Amount?: arrears_state
    datatype: currency 
  - What is the Federal Amount?: arrears_federal

    datatype: noyesradio   
  - What is the name of the court at the top of your latest child support order?: cs_court
    datatype: dropdown
    code: pf_courts

    datatype: noyesradio   
  - What does your latest order say you must pay?: cs_amount
    datatype: currency
    show if: dor_cse_notice_amount_wrong
  - Does the court order say you must pay  ${dbd_period_string(dor_cse_notice_frequency)} : dor_cse_notice_frequency_wrong
    datatype: noyesradio   
  - How often does your order say you must pay child support?: cs_frequency
    datatype: number
    code: |
      period_list()
    show if: dor_cse_notice_frequency_wrong

  Events that may have caused your child support problem

  Your child support order could have changed and:
  
  * you did not know about it, or
  * DOR/CSE did not know about it.

  Give DOR copies of the proof you have

question: |
  Do you have documentation that supports your claim?
subquestion: |
  Do you have documentation that supports your claim?

  *Caroline question: **all child support orders, or all P & F court orders that obligor was a party in, or orders in all courts?***
  3. If applicable—give **all** copies to DOR immediately. 
  
  DOR may recalculate the amount of back child support you owe based on the documentation you give them. 
  
  If you think there is something wrong with the Court order(s) itself, and not DOR, you may need to file something with the Court instead of talking to DOR.
