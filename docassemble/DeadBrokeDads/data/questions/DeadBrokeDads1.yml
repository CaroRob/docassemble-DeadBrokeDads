  Welcome!
  If the Department of Revenue Child Support Enforcement (DOR/CSE) sent you a Notice of Child Support Delinquency, you may not have to pay **everything** on the notice. 
  
  If DOR/CSE has taken some action that makes it hard for you pay back the child support you owe, you can ask them for a break.
  
  Sometimes the DOR makes mistakes.
  
  Sometimes they recognize that you cannot pay back everything. 
  They can decide they will not charge you, 
  * interest (?)
  * penalties
  * the amount of child support you owe them.*

  They can also undo actions they have taken that make it hard for you to pay overdue child support.
  
  We are going to ask you questions to help you fill out the forms you need to get help with your back child support. 

  Shall we get started?
yesno: get_started
section: Introduction
under: |
  Note: Just to be clear -  we can **only** help with money you owe the Department of Revenue. 
  You must still pay any back child support you owe your child's other parent.

question: |
  What does the Notice of Delinquent Child Support from DOR/CSE say?
subquestion: |
  These notices can be confusing. The amount under ${other_parent.name.first}'s name,  is supposed to be your regular child support payment.
  In the middle is how often you are supposed to pay child support.
  The amount on the right is the amount of back child support or arrears, + interest + penalties that DOR CSE says you owe.
  What does DOR/CSE say these are?
  The notice should look something like this:
