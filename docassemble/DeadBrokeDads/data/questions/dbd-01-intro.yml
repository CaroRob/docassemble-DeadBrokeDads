id: 01 Welcome
question: | 
  Welcome!
subquestion: |
  If DOR/CSE sent you a Notice of Child Support Delinquency you may not have to pay **everything** on the notice. 
  
    They can decide not to charge you:

    * interest, (?)
    * penalties,
    * the amount of child support you owe them.* 

    They can also undo actions they have taken that make it hard for you to pay overdue child support.
    
    We will ask you questions to help you fill out the forms you need to get help with the money DOR says you them.

  Shall we get started?
yesno: get_started
under: |
  Note: Just to be clear -  we can **only** help with money you owe the Department of Revenue. 
  You must still pay any back child support you owe your child's other parent.
