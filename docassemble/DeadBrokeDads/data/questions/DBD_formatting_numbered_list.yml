question: |
  You need more information or documentation
subquestion: |
  1. Go to the Court, 
  2. Get copies of **all** court orders, and
  *Caroline question: **all child support orders, or all P & F court orders that obligor was a party in, or orders in all courts?***
  3. If applicableâ€”give **all** copies to DOR immediately. 
  
  DOR may recalculate the amount of back child support you owe based on the documentation you give them. 
  
  If you think there is something wrong with the Court order(s) itself, and not DOR, you may need to file something with the Court instead of talking to DOR.
