question: |
  Fall behind?
subquestion: |
  'if not' in code gives values for both No and I don't know.
  
  'Else' after 'if not' gives values for yes.
  
  If we wanted to give unique values for each answer the syntax would be double equals signs (==) False and None.
  
  We can just write 'if variable:' for condition for True value.
